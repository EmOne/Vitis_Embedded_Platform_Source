## 2021.1

- VCK190 Base Platform enables ECC on DDR and LPDDR; constraints become concise.
- MPSoC base platforms increased CMA size to 1536M. All Vitis-AI models can run with this CMA size.
- Embedded platform creation flow gets simplified: Device Tree Generator can automatically generate a ZOCL node; XSCT can generate BIF files. Base platform source files are reduced.
