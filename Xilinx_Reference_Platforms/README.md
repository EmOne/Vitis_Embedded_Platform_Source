# Xilinx Reference Platforms

The platforms in this directory can work with Vitis 2020.2. They have some additional features than base platforms. But they have not run through the official validation process. Please take them as complementary refereneces beyond the base platforms.

Currently, there are no reference platforms for Vitis 2020.2. They will be added when available. Please visit other branches for reference platforms for other Vitis releases
